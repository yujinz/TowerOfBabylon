Tower Of Babylon is a 2D platform game in 3D world. The creative part of this game is that the player can control jumping and attacking using one joystick of the Xbox controller.

The game is made with Unity3d. To get a executable file, please open the project with Unity and go to File-->Build Settings, select your "Target Platform" (I didn't have chance to try it for MAC, but it should work for Windows), and click Build And Run.

I am planning to make a trailer video so that you could have a glance of this game without installing Unity.
