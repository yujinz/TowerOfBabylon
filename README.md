Tower Of Babylon is a 3D platform game, where the hero climbs a four-sided tower while dogding and attacking enemies. The creative part of this game is that the player can control jumping and attacking using one joystick on the Xbox controller.

The game is made with with Unity3d in C#. To get an executable program and play the game, you need to have Unity 5 installed and have an Xbox controller connected to your computer. Then you open the project with Unity and go to `File-->Build Settings`, select your Target Platform (I didn't have a chance to try it for MAC, but it should work for Windows), and click `Build And Run`.
